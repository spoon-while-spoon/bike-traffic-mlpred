# BikeTrafficPredict - Berlin 
*A machine-learning project*

*btp-berlin* is a experimental learning project in which we trying to train a model to be able to predict bike traffic in certain areas depending on weather data and also possible unpredictable events like covid and the lockdows. 
*btp-berlin* is trained in data from 2015 to 2022.
